whats is object-oriented programming
*************************************
Object is an instance of class
class is a template for class
 
class -> home blueprint
object -> actual home

A programming paradiagram centered 
              ----------
around object rather than functions.
       ------
                                                
OOPS is not a programming language or tool.

suported
C#, java, Ruby, Python, Javascript

Why we need oop ?
-------------------
example:
we take video game, player is the one of the object
we stored player health, position and size multiple 
data can be stored in single player.

class is a common template we can reuse it in many object 


4 Pillars of OOPS
*******************
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Variable called property
function called method

1. Encapsulation
-----------------
we can be group the data,function and method reduce complexity,
increase reusability

hiding data prevent direct access from outside.

access through function (Getter and Setter)
getter->get the information
setter->modify the information

2. Abstraction
-----------------
Only show essential detail
hide all other details

Reduce complexity also isolate impact of change
simple iterface
Reduce the impact of change

Java:-
Interface(show outside) and Implementation(hide from outside)


3. Inheritance
---------------
Allow classes to use data and method from another class

eliminate redundant code
Inheritance some other property and method

          Superclass
   |-----------|----------|---
subclass1   subclass2   subclass3
    |
   -|--------------|
  subclass4  subclass5

subclass Inherit from Superclass

access modifiers:-
changes where class data can be accessed from
(public(default), private and protected)

4. Polymorphism
-----------------
Ability of methods to take more than one from

Refactor ugly switch case statement
many form

Javascript has a dynamic type system:-

-Occurs during runtime
-Both Superclass and subclass have same method
