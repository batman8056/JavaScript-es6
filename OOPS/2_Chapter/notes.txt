Inheritance
************
=> In Javascript we don't have class we have Only object.
=> Allow object(class) to use data and method from another Object(class).

          Superclass(prototype)
   |-----------|----------|---
subclass1   subclass2   subclass3
    |
   -|--------------|
  subclass4  subclass5

=> Two type of Inheritance (Classical and Prototypical)


Prototypical Inheritance:-
------------------------
=>A prototype is just a regular object.
=>basicaly all the objects are in prototype.

example :-
//x is the prototype
let x= {};

//x is the prototype of the array
//in the same array inside we have prototype object 
let x= [];

multi-level Inheritance:-
--------------------------
   objectBase
       |
    arrayBase
       |
    myArray

=> myArray derived arrayBase and arrayBase derived objectBase
   this is what we call multi-level inheritanc.

=> Object created by a given constructor
   will have the same prototype.


example: 1_multi-levelinheritance.js
